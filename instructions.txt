Objective

    The goal with this exercise is to create a simple tic tac toe game which can identify if one player wins, or if the game ends in a draw. 

Requirements

    In the HTML file, there must be a 3x3 grid (the squares of the tic tac toe game)

    Using a single, delegated event, add either an X or O to a cell when it is clicked on

    Simply alternate between adding an X or O using the same event

    Once a cell is filled with a character, prevent it from being changed if it is clicked again

    Determine if either X or O has won, or if the game has ended in a draw
